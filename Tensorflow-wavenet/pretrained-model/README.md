# Pre-trained model for a Wavenet implementation

Pre-trained model for the [Wavenet implementation](github.com/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet)
The network was trained over 300 16-seconds length files from Brian Eno's Music for Airports and An Ending Ascent Long Version. Both songs were obtained from youtube and the dataset was splitted using the ./download-from-youtube.sh script provided by the SampleRNN implementation by deepsound: github.com/deepsound-project/samplernn-pytorch

The network was trained for around 123.000 epochs.
